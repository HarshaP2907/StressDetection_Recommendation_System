# Stress-Detection-and-Recommendation
We have worked on a Stress Detection system which calculates the stress value by using facial detection, to be more precise eyebrow detection and using the distance between the eyebrows and based on the emotion/label that it detects, we get some recommendations of tips, websites, YouTube videos, songs and some tunes that are played.
